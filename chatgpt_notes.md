Building an application to manage investments, with a focus on using Python and the bt module for backtesting, is an ambitious and potentially rewarding project. To ensure a structured approach to your project, we'll outline a plan that covers key aspects such as requirements gathering, system design, development phases, testing, and deployment. This plan aims to provide a roadmap for creating a robust and efficient investment management application.

### 1. Requirements Gathering
Start by detailing the specific functionalities and features you want your application to have. Consider these questions:

- What financial instruments will your application manage (e.g., stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies)?
  - `bt`
- What investment strategies do you intend to implement and backtest?
  - **TBC**
- What data sources will you use for market data, and how will you access them (APIs, web scraping, etc.)?
  - `yfinance`
- What performance metrics are important for evaluating your strategies (e.g., return, risk, Sharpe ratio)?
  - **Sortino Ratio**
- How will you handle real-time data processing, and what is the expected latency?
  - `alpaca API` - not expecting latency to be a huge deal as it will do monthly trades (except for backstops)
- What are your criteria for automatically executing trades, and how will you integrate with brokerage APIs?
  - Balance portfolio monthly according to sortino
  - Pick 5 stocks from 4 different industries
### 2. System Design and Architecture
With the requirements in place, design your application's architecture. Consider using a modular approach where different components handle specific tasks, such as data ingestion, strategy backtesting, trade execution, and performance monitoring. Key components might include:

- **Data Management Module:** Handles the acquisition, cleaning, and storage of historical and real-time market data.
- **Strategy Module:** Implements various investment strategies and provides tools for their configuration.
- **Backtesting Engine:** Utilizes the bt module to simulate strategies with historical data, allowing for performance evaluation.
- **Trade Execution Module:** Connects to brokerage APIs to place trades based on signals generated by your strategies.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Tracks the performance of your investments and notifies you of significant events or changes.

### 3. Development Phases
Break down the development process into manageable phases. A suggested approach could be:

- **Phase 1:** Data Management Module Development
  - Implement data fetching from chosen sources.
  - Develop a system for data cleaning and normalization.
  - Set up a database for storing historical data.
- **Phase 2:** Strategy Development and Backtesting
  - Implement initial investment strategies.
  - Integrate the bt module for backtesting strategies with historical data.
  - Evaluate strategy performance and refine as needed.
- **Phase 3:** Trade Execution System
  - Develop the trade execution module with the ability to place trades through a brokerage API.
  - Implement risk management and compliance checks before executing trades.
- **Phase 4:** Monitoring, Alerts, and UI
  - Implement a monitoring system for real-time performance tracking.
  - Develop an alert system for important metrics or events.
  - Consider developing a user interface for easy interaction with your system.
### 4. Testing
Thoroughly test each component individually and the system as a whole. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and backtesting strategies over different market conditions to ensure reliability and performance.

### 5. Deployment
Plan for the deployment of your application, considering whether it will run on a local machine, in the cloud, or on a dedicated server. Ensure that your deployment environment is secure, especially if connecting to brokerage accounts for trade execution.

### 6. Maintenance and Iteration
After deployment, continuously monitor your application for any issues and make improvements based on performance data and new insights. Be prepared to update your strategies and system components as market conditions evolve.

### Additional Considerations
- Compliance and Security: Ensure your application complies with all relevant financial regulations and that your system is secure, especially regarding API keys and personal data.
- Cost: Be aware of potential costs associated with data sources, API usage, and cloud hosting.

This project plan provides a comprehensive outline to guide the development of your investment management application. Remember, the complexity of financial markets and investment strategies means that continuous learning and adaptation are key to success.
